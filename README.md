📧 Spam Email Detector
A robust and efficient spam email detection project leveraging the power of Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization, implemented in Python with the scikit-learn library.


📝 Project Description
This project tackles the pervasive issue of spam by classifying incoming emails as either spam (unsolicited and often malicious content) or ham (legitimate correspondence). It employs a well-established methodology:

Data Acquisition and Preparation: Utilizing a labeled dataset (mail_data.csv) containing examples of spam and ham emails.
Text Preprocessing: Transforming raw email text into a numerical format suitable for machine learning. This is achieved through TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which weighs the importance of words in each email relative to the entire dataset.
Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression model, a linear classifier known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, on the processed data.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on a held-out test set to ensure its generalization ability.
Prediction: Enabling the model to predict whether new, unseen emails are spam or ham.
The implemented model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.

⚙️ Usage
Follow these simple steps to run the spam email detector on your local machine.

1. 📥 Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-detector.git
cd spam-email-detector
```

2. 🛠️ Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. 🚀 Run the Spam Detector
Execute the main Python script to run the spam detection process:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. 💾 Dataset
The project utilizes a CSV file (mail_data.csv) containing labeled email data. You can:

Use your own mail_data.csv file, ensuring it has appropriate columns for email content and labels (e.g., 'subject', 'body', 'label').
Download publicly available spam datasets, such as the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, and adapt your data loading accordingly.
